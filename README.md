# Time-Series-Forecasting-with-XGBoost


Product demand forecasting has always been critical to decide how much inventory to buy, especially for brick-and-mortar grocery stores. More accurate forecasting with machine learning could prevent overstock of perishable goods or stockout of popular items.

This study aims for forecasting store sales for Corporaci√≥n Favorita, a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer. The XGBoost algorithm was used to address the Multivariate Time Series problem.
